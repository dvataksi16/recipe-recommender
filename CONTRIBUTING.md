## Work Flow Type
**Trunk Based Workflow**

## Team Norms 

### How we will reach consensus:
  1. Unanimous consensus through compromise
  2. Random number generator to decide ties

### How we will work together:
  1. Rotating Product Owner and Scrum Master roles
  2. Assign weekly tasks at Sunday scrums
  3. Post any questions you have on slack
  4. Be very open with issues/conflicts/commitments
  5. Assigned partner reviewer every sprint, partners change every sprint
 
### How we will resolve conflict(s):
  1. Constant communication
  2. Transparency of problems and constraints
  
### Definition of done (minimum requirements stories must meet) = 
  1. On GitHub branch (not merged to trunk)
  2. Completed peer code review
  3. Completed to best of understanding of specifications/requirements
  4. Notify team members (in slack) when done and about to push

### What will do when team member(s) fail to meet obligations:
  1. Ask why?
  2. Give team members a heads up on busy weeks
  3. Try to address issue if possible

### Time frame for responding to messages/emails:
  1. Within 2 hours during the day (especially during week days)
  2. More flexible late night and early morning
  2. Less strict on Saturdays and Fridays (when not used for back-up stand-up meeting)

## Stand-up Schedule: 
  Monday: 9:00 p.m. (remote)  
  Tuesday: 10:30 a.m. (in person)  
  Thursday: 10:30 a.m. (in person)  
  Sunday: 9:00 p.m. (remote), every other week (mid-scrum) is the product backlog grooming; every other week is scrum/team reflection (end-of-scrum)  
  Friday (backup): 7:00 p.m.  

## Rules for prioritizing Backlog
  1. Feasibility
  2. Set up foundation first
  3. If one user story depends on another, complete in sequence
