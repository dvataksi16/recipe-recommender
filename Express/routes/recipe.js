  'description': "Sous Vide French Dip Sandwiches! Cooking sous vide makes the most tender roast beef EVER. This is a perfect starter recipe if you're new to sous vide cooking.",
  'directions': ["This roast cooks sous vide for 18 to 24 hours, so it's important to begin\xa0cooking with your serving time\xa0in mind. Calculate backward from your dinner time to figure out when you should start cooking the roast.",
   "For make-ahead instructions if you don't plan on serving your sandwiches right away, see\xa0the instructions in the headnotes.",
   "Trim any large pieces of fat from the exterior of the roast, but don't worry about getting every last speck. Season it on all sides with the salt and pepper.",
   'Warm a large skillet over medium-high heat and add\xa01 tablespoon of oil. When the oil shimmers and glides smoothly, and a flick of water evaporates on contact with the pan, add the roast.',
   'Sear the roast\xa0very well on all sides, 4 to\xa05 minutes per side. The seared surfaces should look dark reddish-brown. If the oil starts to get smoky, lower the heat slightly; otherwise, maintain a medium-high heat for the best sear.',
   ' ',
   ' ',
   'If the roast is still scorching hot from the pan when you put it in the plastic bag, it can melt a hole in the plastic.',
   'With the pan still over medium-high heat, add the wine all at once. It will bubble and steam as it hits the pan. As it bubbles, use a stiff spatula to scrape up any dark bits that were stuck.',
   "Once you've scraped up all the bits and the wine is simmering, pour it carefully into a measuring cup. Let it cool slightly.",
   ' ',
   'Place a 1-gallon plastic freezer bag on your counter and fold the top outwards to form a cuff; this will help it stand up and make it easier to fill. (Alternatively, place the bag in a bowl while\xa0filling).',
   'Place the slightly cooled roast into the bag. Pour the wine and broth over top, and tuck the bay leaf inside. Zip the bag almost entirely shut, leaving about an inch open at one edge.',
   ' ',
   ' ',
   'Fill a large stock pot three-quarters full with water. Submerge the bag with the roast until just the zipper part of the bag is above the water.',
   'As you submerge the bag, the pressure of the water will\xa0press the sides of the plastic bag up against the roast and the liquid, "hugging"\xa0the ingredients. You may need to use your hands or a spatula to poke the roast below the surface of the water and force out any bubbles.',
   'Once all the air bubble are out, submerge the bag up to the zipper, then zip it all the way closed so the bag is sealed. Lift the roast\xa0from the water and place it on a dishtowel while you heat the water.',
   "As you lift the bag, the plastic should look like it's hugging the ingredients inside the bag. A few small\xa0air pockets are fine; vacuum-sealing isn't necessary. Check\xa0carefully to make sure the bag isn't leaking; if it is, transfer it to a new bag and repeat this sealing step.",
   ' ',
   'Place the pot of water on a trivet or other heatproof surface.\xa0Place the immersion circulator in the water and set it to heat the water based on your preferred doneness for the roast beef: 135°F (medium-rare), 140°F (medium), 145°F (medium-well) or 150°F (well-done).',
   "It will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes for the water to heat, depending on the volume of water in your pot. (You can also use warm water out of the tap to cut down on heating time.) Once the water is up to temp, your immersion circulator will indicate that you're ready to start cooking.",
   ': Open the app on your phone and press the orange circular button in the bottom right corner. Input the temperature\xa0and press the orange button again to start the device\xa0and begin heating the water.',
   ' ',
   "Once the water has finished heating, lower the roast into the water. It's fine if the zipper is above the surface of the water, but the roast itself should be completely submerged by at least an inch or so. Add more water if needed.",
   "Cook the roast for 18 to 24 hours (yes, hours!). It will become more tender the longer you let it cook. Set a\xa0timer so you know when it's ready.",
   ' ',
   ' ',
   "Every so often during cooking, take a peek at your roast and make sure that it's still submerged in the water and the bag isn't leaking. (If it's leaking, the liquid will start to look diluted and you'll notice air bubbles in the bag. Just transfer the roast and liquid to another bag and carry on with cooking. This doesn't happen very often, but is something to watch out for.)",
   "Keep an eye on the water level and add additional water if it looks like it's getting low. The immersion circulator will heat the water right back up to temperature. To help prevent evaporation, you can also cover your pot with plastic wrap, a silicon bowl cover (as I have), or any other cover.",
   'At any point during this cooking time\xa0when you have a spare 10 minutes, cook the onions. Warm a teaspoon or two of oil in a skillet and cook the onions with 1/4 teaspoon salt until they are very soft\xa0and browned.',
   "If you're not serving them right away, cool and refrigerate until needed. To reheat, add them to\xa0a hot skillet and stir until warmed through.",
   "When you're done cooking the roast, lift the bag from the water and set it on a kitchen towel on the counter. Warm a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.",
   'Open the bag with the roast; be careful not to spill any of the cooking liquid. Use tongs to lift the roast from the bag and transfer it to a cutting board. Pat it dry on all sides.',
   'Transfer the roast to the hot skillet and sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the outside is very crusty. Add more oil as needed to the pan. Once seared, set the roast on a cutting board until ready to slice.',
   ' ',
   ' ',
   ' ',
   ' While the roast sears, strain the cooking liquid ("jus") into a measuring cup. Taste and add salt or pepper if needed. If the jus seems overly\xa0concentrated to you, add a little water to thin it out again.',
   'Use a little of the jus to deglaze the pan after searing the roast, if you like.',
   'Transfer the jus to individual cups for serving.',
   ' ',
   'Warm the oven to 400F. Open up all the French rolls and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet with the cut sides facing up. Toast in the hot oven until they are warm and feel crispy when you press the surface of the bread, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, but leave the oven on.',
   'If you like, spoon a little of the beef jus over the bottom buns for flavor.',
   "Use a sharp chef's knife and slice the beef against the grain as thinly as possible.",
   'Pile slices of beef on the bottom half of the rolls. The meat should divide equally between all the rolls, but you may have some leftover.',
   'Top each pile of beef with some onions and a slice or two of cheese, if desired.',
   ' ',
   'Set aside the tops of the buns so they don\'t burn.\xa0Switch the oven to "broil" and slide the pan of sandwiches under the broiler. Broil until the cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute.',
   'Top each sandwich with the top bun. Serve with the jus alongside for dipping. (Refrigerate leftovers and consume within 3 to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.)'],

   ' In a large sauté pan, pour enough water to cover the bottom by about 1/8 inch. Over medium heat, cook the salt pork in the pan until the water evaporates, stirring occasionally. Once the water is gone, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to cook the salt pork until much of the fat has rendered out of it. Add a tablespoon of butter and continue to cook the salt pork unti the pieces are browned and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the salt pork pieces to a large Dutch oven or other large, thick-bottomed, lidded pot.',
   " Increase the heat to medium-high. Working in batches so that you do not crowd the pan, brown the beef. Leaving space around each piece of sizzling meat ensures that it browns and does not steam. Don't move the pieces of beef in the pan until they get a good sear, then turn them so they can get browned on another side. Take your time. This will take 15-25 minutes, depending on how large a sauté pan you have. Once browned, remove the beef from the sauté pan and place in the Dutch oven with the salt pork.",
   ' When all the beef has browned, add the shallots, the one chopped carrot, and the chopped porcini mushrooms if using. Stir in the pot to remove any browned, stuck-on bits in the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add the garlic and the tomato paste. Cook another 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.',
   ' Add the brandy and stir to combine. Boil down by half, then add the strained mushroom soaking water (if using). Scrape any remaining browned bits off the bottom of the sauté pan and pour the contents of the pan into the Dutch oven.',
   ' To the Dutch oven add the bottle of wine and enough beef stock to almost cover the beef; the beef pieces should be barely poking up out of the liquid. Add the parsley, bay leaves, thyme and cloves. Cover and bring to a bare simmer. After 1 hour, add the second carrot, peeled and cut into chunks of 1-2 inches. Continue cooking for another hour, or until the beef is tender.',
   ' Meanwhile, trim the tough stems off the shiitake, cremini, or button mushrooms and slice into 2-3 large pieces; small mushrooms leave whole. Prepare the pearl onions. Boil them in their skins for 4-5 minutes. Drain and submerge in a bowl of ice water. Slice the tips and root ends off the onions and slip off the outer skins.',
   ' When the beef is tender, use tongs to remove all the beef and the chunks of carrots; set aside in a bowl. Strain the contents of the Dutch oven through a fine-meshed sieve set over a medium pot. This will be the sauce. Boil the sauce down, tasting frequently. If it begins to taste too salty, turn off the heat. Otherwise, boil down until you have about 3 cups. Turn off the heat.',
   ' Heat a large sauté pan over high heat and add the mushrooms. Dry sauté the mushrooms over high heat, shaking the pan and stirring often, until they release their water, about 4-5 minutes. Add the pearl onions and 3 tablespoons butter and toss to combine. Sprinkle salt over the onions and mushrooms. Sauté until the onions begin to brown. Remove from heat.',
   ' Returning to the sauce, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in the beurre manie. Whisk in a third of the paste, wait for it to incorporate into the sauce, then add another third of the beurre manie, and so on. Do not let this boil, but allow it to simmer very gently for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of brandy. Taste for salt and add some if needed.',

  'description': 'Step-by-step detailed instructions and photos on roasting a goose.',
  'directions': ['To start, if the goose has been refrigerated, bring it to room temperature before cooking. Keep it in its plastic wrapping until you are ready to cook it. While in the refrigerator, and or while you are bringing it to room temp, have the bird resting in a pan, so that if the plastic covering leaks for any reason, you are confining the juices to the pan. If you get a frozen goose, which is most likely the case, you will need to defrost it in the refrigerator for two days first.',
   'While I have never found any instances of food poisoning from raw duck or goose, it’s best to handle the goose with common sense. Use a separate cutting board and utensils to avoid contaminating other foods. Wash your hands with soap frequently – if for no other reason than because geese are fatty and you don’t want to be walking around with greasy hands. Use paper towels to clean up.',
   '\xa0',
   'Remove the neck and giblets (heart, gizzard, liver). Use them for making the gravy. You want to remove the last two joints of the wings, too, and use them for the gravy as well.',
   ' ',
   'To do this, use a thin sharp knife – a boning knife is ideal, or you could use a paring knife or fillet knife – and cut across the side of the joint, severing the tendons. Bend the joint the opposite way it is supposed to go to break it. Cut the remaining skin and tendons. You should not need to cut bone at all.',
   'Slice off the neck skin about a half inch in front of the body.',
   ' ',
   '\xa0',
   'You also need to remove excess fat from the goose. You will want to save it – goose fat is among the most delicious of all cooking fats, and it is far healthier than butter or lard.',
   'First grab the fat inside the body cavity and put it in a bowl.',
   ' ',
   'Now slice off the wide belly flaps covering the body cavity; if you plan on stuffing the goose you’d need these, but we’re not, so out they go. You also want to remove the Pope’s nose, which is the goose’s tail. All of this should go into a pot with a little water (about ½ cup) and put over low heat to render out.',
   ' ',
   '\xa0',
   'You still need to give all that fat underneath the goose’s skin somewhere to go—if you don’t, the skin will never fully crisp up. I’ve found the best way to do this is to prick it with a clean needle. The technique is to stick the skin from an angle so you are not piercing the meat of the goose, just the skin. Do this all over the goose.',
   '\n',
   'Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.',
   'Rub the goose all over with the cut half of a lemon. Use both sides to get it good and coated. Put the halves inside the goose.',
   ' ',
   'Sprinkle salt liberally all over the goose. Use more salt than you think you need; it helps crisp the skin and adds a lot to the flavor.',
   'Slice off the top of a head of garlic and place it inside the goose.',
   'Place the goose breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan and into the oven.',
   '\xa0',
   'Meanwhile, start the gravy. Chop and brown all the giblets, wings and neck in some goose fat in a large pan. Sprinkle salt over them.',
   ' ',
   'Add the chopped onion and stir to combine. When the onion gets a little browned, sprinkle the flour in the pot and stir to combine. Cook this over medium heat, stirring often, until it smells nutty—about 5-10 minutes. Turn the heat up to high and add the Madeira.',
   ' ',
   'Let this boil furiously for a minute or two, then add the chicken stock and stir to combine. Add the dried thyme. Turn the gravy down to a bare simmer.',
   '\xa0',
   'After the goose has cooked for 20 minutes, add any chunks of root veggies you might feel like using. I like a mix of potatoes, turnips, carrots and parsnips. Here’s a tip: Toss them in some rendered goose fat and salt them before placing in the bottom of the roasting pan.',
   'You can also use this time as an opportunity to spoon out some of the goose fat that may be collecting in the bottom of the roasting pan. Put it in the pot with the rendering goose fat.',
   'When you’re done, put the goose back into the oven for another 20 minutes.',
   '\xa0',
   'When a total of 40 minutes of cooking time has elapsed, test the temperature of the breast. You should have something between 130 and 140 degrees. If you’re there, remove the goose but keep the oven on.',
   ' ',
   'Now you need to carve off the whole breasts. Using a thin knife—again, a boning knife is ideal—make a slice where the breast meets the leg\xa0and another slice where the breast meets the wing.',
   ' ',
   'Then slice along the keel bone, which separates the two halves of the breast. Go straight down and tap the point of the blade against the breastbone as you move the knife up toward the wishbone, then back toward the open body cavity.',
   ' ',
   'Know that a goose has a deep keel and that the breastbone comes out wide at almost a right angle from it, so work your knife in short, gentle strokes out to free the whole side of the breast. Once you get near the wishbone, find it with the tip of your knife and carefully slice around it. Repeat on the other side.',
   ' ',
   'Remove the breasts and tent with foil.',
   '\xa0',
   'Put the goose (minus the breasts) back into the oven. Let this cook for another 30 to 40\xa0minutes.',
   'After 30 minutes, probe the thickest part of the goose’s thigh with a thermometer. Remove the goose when the temperature is between 165-170°F.\xa0\xa0Check the root veggies, and if they are done, great. If not, keep them in the oven for the moment.',
   'Remove the garlic from the goose. Tent the goose with foil and set aside.',
   '\xa0',
   'Remove the garlic cloves from the husk and put the cloves into the simmering goose gravy. Let this cook for 5 minutes. Fish out the neck and wing pieces and pick off any bits and toss them into the gravy. Pour the gravy into a blender and purée it until completely smooth–work\xa0in batches to avoid the gravy\xa0spurting out of your blender. You want a thick gravy, so if it is too thick add water. If it’s too thin, don’t worry, you can cook it down.',
   'Return the gravy to the pot and put on low heat. Simmer it more if it is too thin.',
   '\xa0',
   'Now get a large sauté pan hot. Add some goose fat, and let that get hot over medium-high heat.',
   'Take the goose breasts, which should be a lovely pink on the meat side, and pat them dry. Place them skin side down in the pan and sear the skin hard. You might need to press down on them a little to get good contact. Check after 3-4 minutes. You want a rich brown.',
   ' ',
   'When it is ready, remove the breasts – don’t cook them on the meat side! – and immediately salt the skin. Set aside, skin side up. Move the pan off the heat.',
   '\xa0',
   'Carve off the legs and wings of the goose.',
   ' ',
   'Get the pan hot again and sear the skin surfaces of the legs and wings. While this is searing, slice the breast (at an angle is nice) skin side up. Salt the legs and wings and serve with the root veggies.',

With your (clean) hands work the rub mixture into the pork shoulder all over, including inside any crevasses you may find in a boneless roast where the bone had been.

   ' Take 3 or 4 large handfuls of wood chips (hickory, oak, apple or other fruit wood) and place them in a bowl and cover them with water to soak them overnight (can also do for an hour before using).

The larger chunks will take longer to catch, but last well past when the smaller chips have burned themselves out.',

   ' ',
   ' Remove one of the grill grates. This will be your "hot" side, where the wood chips will go. The other side of the grill will be the "cool" side, and where the meat will be, away from direct heat. Depending on the structure of your grill, you may want to remove the "flavor bar", the thin metal piece with lots of holes in it that sits over the burner. The wood chips will smoke more easily if they lay in a (fireproof metal or foil) container directly on the burner.',
   ' If there is room on your grill, place a small aluminum tray of water on the grill to help moderate the heat and help keep the roast from getting too dry. A good place to place this is on an upper rack if you grill has one.',

Place the boat directly on the burner on the "hot" side of the grill if you can (otherwise place on the flavor bar). Turn the grill on to medium flame, cover the grill and let it heat up until the the wood chips start smoking. You\'ll either see smoke coming out of the grill, or if you raise the lid, you\'ll see smoke coming out of the wood chip boat. You should see and smell the smoke. You\'ll be replenishing the wood chips periodically for the next several hours so put more dry chips into water to soak if needed.',
   " Once the grill is smoking, place the roast on the grill grates on the cool side of the grill, away from direct heat. If your grill has a hot spot, position the roast away from it. If there is a fatty side to the meat, put that side facing up; the fat will render over time and baste the pork. Cover the grill, lower the flame, and let the cooking begin. The temperature you want to maintain ideally is 225°F. Try to keep it close to that temperature, within a range of 210°F to 240°F. If the temperature goes too high, the roast may dry out. If it's too low, it will take forever to cook.",
   ' ',
   ' This is the tricky part. You will want to maintain smoke in the grill for at least 4 hours (6 hours for a bigger roast). You will also want to maintain a cooking temperature of around 225°. So, you have to check the grill! Check if the temperature is being maintained between 210°F and 240°F, and check to make sure the chips are still producing smoke, every half hour. About once an hour you will likely need to replenish the chip boat with more wood chips. Resist the temptation to open the grill more than once an hour. Every time you open the grill the inside temperature drops and you increase your overall cooking time.',
   "I found the best way to check the temperature, since I don't have a gauge in the grill itself, is to put an instant read meat thermometer into an opening in the hood on the meat side (cool side) of the grill, and just keep checking it. Make sure sensor tip of the probe is not touching the meat itself. You want to avoid opening up the hood too often, because every time you do that, you lose heat. Of course, if your gas grill gets too hot, opening the hood can cool it down quickly.",
   'Expect a minimum cooking time, if you have been diligent at maintaining a 225°F, of 90 minutes per pound. So if you are cooking a 4 pound roast, total cooking time will be at least 6 hours (and easily more). An 8 pound roast will take at least 12 hours of cooking time. (If you want to cook 8 pounds of pork shoulder more quickly, I recommend starting with two 4 pound roasts, spaced on the grill a few inches apart, which will cook in just a little more time than an 8 pound roast.)',
   ' After 2 or 3 hours, during one of your hourly opening of the grill to refresh the wood chips, reposition the roast so that the side that was closest to the heat is now furthest from the heat.',
   ' ',
   " After about 5 hours, start taking the pork's internal temperature: You can eat it at 165°F, but if you are making pulled pork the meat needs to be ideally 195°F. When the meat reaches 195°F, remove it from the heat, tent it loosely with foil over a cutting board (to catch the juices) and let it rest for at least 30 minutes, and preferably 1 hour. If after 6 hours of cooking, if the meat hasn't reached 195° internal temp (usually after 6 hours, the internal temp on my roasts is about 155°F), my recommendation is to remove it from the grill and finish in the oven.",
   ' ',
   ' Wrap the roast in aluminum foil to help prevent it from drying out in the oven, and place it in a roasting pan, in a 300°F oven. Cook until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 195°F. If your starting internal meat temperature is 150°F or so, this can take anywhere from an hour to two hours. When it reaches temperature, remove the roast from the oven and let rest for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour.',

   ' Pull the pork with 2 forks. Only now do you add any barbecue sauce (and any accumulated juices) to the meat. Taste it first: It might not need sauce at all, and if it does, add only a little at a time. One of the biggest sins of barbecue is to oversauce perfectly good meat.',

   ' To carve the turkey, cut straight down from the keel bone (the keel bone separates each half of the breast) until your knife hits the breast bone. Slice the meat off and, using short strokes with the knife, free the meat from the bone. If you want, pull off the tender underneath the breast and slice this piece separately; it tends to fall off the rest of the breast when you slice it anyway. Slice the deboned breast and serve.'],
