# Kitchuation

### What are we?
"Have you ever wanted to know what you can cook based on whatâ€™s on your kitchen?"

We are your cooking hack! We are a webapp that allows you to keep and update a virutal representation of your pantry and in return provide you with your recipe matches. We also allow you to filter for foods based on meal preferences and dietary restrictions. We recommend ingredient substitutions. Additionally, you can share your found recipes and cooked meals with friends and family! Enjoy!

### Short History on How We Came to Be
As four fellow college students, we understand the difficulty of preparing a decent meal, having limited ingredients, limited time, and wanting to stay healthy. We just want to simplify cooking for all that enjoy cooking and those who don't so much.
