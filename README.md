# recipe-recommender
The Recipe Recommender project repository

# What are we?
In short, we are a website that allows users to keep and update a virutal representation of their pantry and in return are recommended with recipes to cook based on items they already own

# For whom?
Mainly Millenials. We are for people who like to cook and for those who would like to cook more often.
