### What are we?
We are here to answer "What's for dinner?" We are a cooking hack. We are a webapp that allows you to keep and update a virutal representation of your pantry and in return provide you with your recipe matches. We allow you to filter for foods based on meal preferences, dietary restrictions, calories, and difficulty and time of preparation of meals. We recommend ingredient substitutions. We also update your virtual pantry as you cook. We learn more about you through monitoring your behavior data and preferences and over time are able to provide you with even better matches. Additionally, you can share your found recipes and cooked meals with friends and family!

### Short History on How We Came to Be
As four fellow college students, we understand the difficulty of preparing a decent meal, having limited ingredients, limited time, and wanting to stay healthy. We just want to simplify cooking for all that enjoy cooking and those who don't.
